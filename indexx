  <h1>Galaga 90'</h1>

  <p class="description">
    Galaga '90 is a shoot 'em up video game released by Namco in 1989 for the PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16). 
    It is an enhanced version of the classic <em>Galaga</em> (1981), where the player controls a spaceship 
    that must destroy waves of alien enemies in formations and attack patterns. The game stands out for its 
    colorful graphics, arcade music, branching levels, bonus stages, and the ability to form a double ship by 
    rescuing a captured one. Its simple yet addictive gameplay made it one of the best installments in the series.

  <p class="authors">
    This remake of the game was created by Aidan Albero, Montserrat Medina, and Luana Alemán.

   Each team member contributed significantly to the development of the project, participating in both the programming and the overall design of the game.
Luana was in charge of the enemy movement and helped manage the flow of the introduction screens. She also created a diagram to represent the general structure of the game.
Aidan developed the complete mechanics of the final boss, including its movements and shooting. He also worked on the implementation of enemy bullets and sound effects.
Montserrat was responsible for implementing the player character, including its controls and functionality. Additionally, he managed the screen transitions and developed the user interface (UI).
Finally, the collection of images and the general documentation of the project were done collaboratively with all team members.
